The number of orbital launches in the 'Orbital launches' table in Wikipedia Orbital Launches if at least one of its payloads is reported as 'Successful', 'Operational', or 'En Route'. For each launch, listed by date, the first line is the launch vehicle and any lines below it correspond to the payloads, of which there could be more than one. Please note that there might be multiple launches on a single day with multiple payloads within a single launch (we are only interested in the number of distinct launches). Please refer to the screenshot below highlighting a single payload in the table.
